# Save Point Radio
_"A softer side to video game music."_

**Save Point Radio** was an idea birthed out of the love of ambient/quiet music and video games. This repository is home to the **Save Point Radio** website code, written using cool, guitar-wielding snakes (Python 3.6/Django 2.0).

Started by a single individual with just enough web development knowledge to be dangerous, this is still a heavy work-in-progress and will most likely come online in parts. All suggestions/bug reports are welcome (and encouraged!) as he is learning as he moves along.
